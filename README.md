**Physician Notetaker – AI Medical NLP Assignment**

This project is developed as part of the Emittr AI Engineer Internship Assignment.
It focuses on building an AI-powered NLP pipeline for medical conversations — converting raw physician-patient dialogues into structured medical summaries, sentiment insights, and SOAP notes.


**Project Overview**

*The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, transformer-based AI models, and data structuring for healthcare text.

The pipeline performs the following tasks:

1.Entity Extraction (NER): Detects medical entities like symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

2.Structured Summarization: Converts transcripts into a clean, machine-readable JSON summary.

3.Sentiment & Intent Analysis: Detects the patient’s emotional tone and intent (e.g., Anxious, Reassured, Seeking reassurance).

4.SOAP Note Generation (Bonus): Automatically generates a structured SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) medical note.

**Setup Instructions**

1. Clone or download the project
   git clone https://github.com/taraka111/physician_notetaker_NLP.git
   cd emittr-physician-notetaker

2. Create a virtual Environment
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

   If there is no requirements.txt, install the essentials manually:
   pip install spacy transformers torch nltk
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


**Run the Pipeline**
  python notebooks/01_pipeline_demo.py

You will see outputs printed in the terminal:
---- Transcript ----
---- Extracted Entities ----
---- Structured Summary ----
---- Sentiment & Intent ----
---- SOAP Note ----
---- All outputs saved in 'outputs/' folder ----

All results are also saved automatically in the outputs/ folder as JSON files:
entities.json
sample_output.json
sentiment_intent.json
soap_note.json


**How it works**

| Component                                    | Description                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **NER (ner.py)**                             | Uses spaCy rules and patterns to extract key medical terms such as symptoms, diagnosis, treatments, and prognosis. |
| **Summarizer (summarizer.py)**               | Combines extracted entities into a structured JSON summary resembling a medical report.                            |
| **Sentiment & Intent (sentiment_intent.py)** | Uses transformer-based models (DistilBERT / zero-shot classification) to detect patient sentiment and intent.      |
| **SOAP Generator (soap_generator.py)**       | Organizes text into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan format, commonly used by physicians.               |
